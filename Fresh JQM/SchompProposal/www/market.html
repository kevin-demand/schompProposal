                      <p>Austin. It’s Texas’s token ‘weird’ city, the most diverse city in Texas, home to a thriving economy and soon to be home to a second world-class BMW Dealership. </p>
                      <p>There was a time when Austin was known primarily as the capital of Texas and home of The University of Texas at Austin. Those sectors remain a healthy and vital part of the Austin landscape – but over the last two decades the community has developed a very healthy balance of employment across a diverse range of industries. Over the past decade Austin has been an incubator for hundreds of new tech startups as well as home to long-established tech leaders. Austin knows tech. Apple, IBM, Dell, AT&T, Oracle, HP, Cisco, Intel and Samsung each employ more that 5,000 workers from Austin’s highly educated workforce.</p>
                      <p>Austin has received a mountain of accolades of late and earned a reputation as one of the best places to live in the nation. You don’t need to take our word for it. It’s the #2 city in the country for job growth<sup>1</sup>,the fastest growing city in the nation<sup>2</sup>, and a recent study ranked Austin as the #2 destination for military retirees.<sup>3</sup> </p>

                      <p>We thoroughly understand the competitive landscape in Austin. </p>
                      <p>We commissioned our own Urban Science Market study and have done our homework. We’ve identified tremendous opportunities and are poised to pick a fight with the competition. We know where we need to be located, not based on today’s market but based on what the landscape of Austin will look like 5 and even 10 years from today.</p>
                      <p>Lexus has long led the market and is in the process of adding a second franchise to the market. Mercedes-Benz and Audi also have two points. Those days will come to an end in 2016 and we will play the biggest part in it.</p>

                        <h3>Based on our market findings, BMW of South Austin is poised to do extremely well given the trend not just nationally, but in Austin and points south as well. Our quick findings:</h3>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Based on the performance of the 3 Series and 5 Series Segments, BMW of South Austin is positioned well to retake significant market share in the area.</li>
                          <li>Based on the strength or EV sales and the Plug In EVerywhere™ campaign promoted by the City of Austin, viewed alongside the breadth of the technology sector in Austin, we feel there is significant growth opportunity for the BMW i3. </li>
                          <li>Conquest of aspirational brands in Austin (Honda, Toyota, Nissan, VW and Subaru) holds significant potential. In Austin, these brands outperform the national benchmarks. These aspirational consumers are key to growth of BMW marketshare and the luxury segment as a whole. </li>
                          <li>HHI growth is projected to increase significantly on the Southwestern side of Austin. Our location in Hayes County (3rd Fastest-growing county in the country) is uniquely positioned to take advantage of this growth.</li>
                          <li>Cities south of Austin; Buda, Kyle, San Marcos are among some of the fastest-growing cities in Texas. Our location was selected to offer consumers in those markets a more convenient option vs. Audi, Mercedes-Benz and Lexus.</li>

                      <p>Changes are expected in the population growth rate that make Austin more promising than ever. </p>
                      <p>The long range economic forecast for the Austin - Round Rock - San Marcos MSA shows nothing but growth. Not middle-of-the-pack growth, Exponential Growth. The Austin MSA has grown nearly 40% in the past decade and there’s no sign of it slowing down. When you look towards South Austin and the I-35 corridor, the growth is even more pronounced. The suburbanization of this stretch of I-15 between San Antonio and Austin will continue to intensify in next decade. Just 20 miles south of our proposed location, San Marcos, was the fastest growing city in the country in 2013.</p>
                      <p>“Through 2020, Austin Texas, will be among the three fastest growing large metros in the country<sup>1</sup>. The education/health services and information and professional business services sectors will be some of the most critical sources of economic growth across these metros.”</p>
