                    <h3>BMW of South Austin: <em>The Ultimate Driving Capital of the World</em></h3>
                    <p>It is with great pride and enthusiasm that we respond to this request. For over 75 years the Schomp Automotive Group dealerships have been operated with a commitment to delivering a world-class retail experience with ‘customer first’ sales and service processes. Each Schomp dealership maintains market-share leadership through our ‘One Price. One Person. One Hour.’ philosophy. Simply put, we care deeply about our customers, our cars, our culture and the community in which we operate. It’s no secret that Austin is one of the fastest growing cities in the country. It’s home to the University of Texas, hundreds of tech companies and startup incubators. Austin is also ranked the No. 1 market for millennials – Americans born after 1980 – in terms of concentration, which is 1.2 times the national average, according to a recent Nielsen study.  While the Schomp Automotive Group has a rich history, we have a deep bench of young automotive talent that knows how to sell, how to market and how to connect with the fastest growing customer segment in the business. That’s why we know we’re the perfect fit for BMW in South Austin, and we’re confident you’ll agree. We are honored and humbled to have the opportunity to present our vision for BMW of South Austin. And to say that we’re excited about this is, well, the ULTIMATE understatement.</p>
